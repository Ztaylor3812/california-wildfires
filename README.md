Dashboard of data from wildfires in California

The dataset used is a set containing a list of wildfires that have occured from 2013 to 2020. Each wildfire reported includes the latitude, longitude, date, and acres burned by the incident.

The data was from the California Fire website, https://www.fire.ca.gov/, and was collected and sorted by Kaggle user, ananthu017.

The dashboard I have created visualizes this data through the use of maps and graphs to provide insight into how location, season, and year all factor into the frequency and severity of wildfires.
